# MDE-ODS-Extensions
Repository containing Minnesota Department of Education's Ed-Fi ODS data collection extensions in the form of MetaEd source files.

The files contained in this repo are available to MN school districts or vendors partnering with those districts who have interest in deploying a district based Ed-Fi ODS and API.  The extensions are available in the form of .metaed files which are compatible with MetaEd version 2.0.0.

The current version of the extensions are only compatible with the 3.1.1 Ed-Fi Codebase.

For more information on how to implement extensions using metaed refer to the following documentation on the Ed-Fi Tech Docs website:
